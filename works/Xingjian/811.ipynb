Firstly, we have used <b>Bayesian optimization</b> to tune the hyperparameters of our <b>CatBoost model</b>, which is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm. This approach enables us to automatically search the hyperparameter space, saving us significant amounts of time and manual effort. \n","Furthermore, we have utilized <b>Adversarial Validation</b>, a technique that involves training a model to differentiate between training and test data. This approach allows us to identify whether our model is overfitting or underfitting the training data, thus improving its overall robustness.\n","Additionally, we have implemented <b>Explainable Machine Learning using SHAP</b>, a method that provides insights into how different features affect our model's predictions. This enables us to understand and interpret our model's behavior more effectively, improving our ability to make informed decisions based on its outputs.\n","We have also employed <b>Pseudo Labeling</b>, a technique that involves using a model's predictions on unlabeled data to generate new labeled data. This approach can significantly increase the amount of training data available to us, improving our model's performance on the test data.\n","Lastly, we have used <b>Ensemble Learning</b>, which involves combining the outputs of multiple models to create a final prediction.

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a popular approach for providing model interpretability by measuring the contribution of each feature to a prediction. This enables us to identify which features have the greatest impact on our model's outputs, and how they are related to the predicted values. \n","To perform the SHAP evaluation, we first generate a set of test data and extract the features we want to evaluate. We then use the SHAP library to compute the SHAP values for each feature, which represent the change in the predicted value as a result of changing the feature value while holding all other features constant. These values are visualized using a SHAP summary plot, which shows the features ranked by their importance and the direction of their impact on the predicted value. Through the SHAP summary plot, we can observe the top contributing features to our model's predictions, and how they are positively or negatively correlated with the output. This enables us to gain insights into the underlying relationships between the features and the target variable, improving our understanding of how our model makes its predictions. Overall, the SHAP explainability evaluation provides a valuable tool for gaining insights into the inner workings of our model and making informed decisions based on its outputs.</div>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-14T19:57:53.874145Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-14T19:57:53.873199Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-14T19:59:34.265359Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-14T19:59:34.263397Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-14T19:57:53.874108Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import
